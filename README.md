# Movies-correlation-using-python
This Python-based project explores a vast dataset of Hollywood movies, focusing on cleaning, manipulating, and visualizing the data to uncover interesting correlations and insights.

Project Overview

In this project, we delve into the world of Hollywood movies, employing Python for data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization. The primary goals include:
Data Cleaning: Rigorous cleaning procedures have been implemented to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring a high-quality dataset for analysis.
Data Manipulation: Leveraging powerful Python libraries such as Pandas, we transform raw data into a structured format, enabling seamless correlation analysis. Various statistical techniques are employed to extract meaningful patterns.
Data Visualization: Utilizing Matplotlib and Seaborn, we craft visually appealing and informative plots, graphs, and charts to illustrate correlations within the dataset. This step enhances the storytelling aspect of the data analysis process.

Features:
1.Jupyter Notebooks: The project includes Jupyter Notebooks, providing an interactive and easily understandable walkthrough of the data analysis pipeline.
2.Python Code: Explore well-commented Python scripts detailing the cleaning, manipulation, and visualization processes. The code is designed to be modular and adaptable for similar analyses.
